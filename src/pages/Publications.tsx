                abstract ="Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by impairment of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) via gene mutation. CFTR is expressed at the cellular membrane of epithelial cells and functions as an anion pump which maintains water and salt ion homeostasis. In pulmonary airways of CF patients, pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and subsequent uncontrolled inflammation damage the human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) and can be life-threatening. We previously identified that inhibiting endogenous retroelement (ERE) reverse transcriptase can hamper the inflammatory response to bacterial flagella in THP-1 cells. Here, we investigate how ERE expression is sensitive to HAEC repair and toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) activation, a primary mechanism by which inflammation impacts disease outcome. Our results demonstrate that several human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) fluctuate throughout the various stages of repair and that TLR5 activation further influences ERE expression. By considering the impact of the most common CF mutation F508del/F508del on ERE expression in unwounded HAECs, we also found that two specific EREs, L1FLnI_2p23.1c and HERVH_10p12.33, were downregulated in CF-derived HAECs. Collectively, we show that ERE expression in HAECs is sensitive to certain modalities reflective of CF pathogenesis, and specific EREs may be indicative of CF disease state and pathogenesis."

                abstract = "Endogenous retroelements (EREs), including human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), comprise almost half of the human genome. Our previous studies of the interferome in the gut suggest potential mechanisms regarding how IFNb may drive HIV-1 gut pathogenesis. As ERE activity is suggested to partake in type 1 immune responses and is incredibly sensitive to viral infections, we sought to elucidate underlying interactions between ERE expression and gut dynamics in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). ERE expression profiles from bulk RNA sequencing of colon biopsies and PBMC were compared between a cohort of PLWH not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and uninfected controls. We found 59 EREs differentially expressed in the colon of PLWH when compared to uninfected controls (padj <0.05 and FC ≤ -1 or ≥ 1), with 12 downregulated and 47 upregulated. Colon expression of the ERE loci LTR19_12p13.31 and L1FLnI_1q23.1s showed significant correlations with certain gut immune cell subset frequencies, and L1FLnI_1q23.1s was also significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PLWH, suggesting a common mechanism of differential ERE expression across tissues. These findings indicate that ERE activity is deregulated in the colon of PLWH, supporting the hypothesis that specific EREs could serve as biomarkers and potential mediators of pathogenesis in HIV-1 reservoirs."

                abstract = "SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we used unbiased systems approaches to study the host-selective forces driving VOC evolution. We discovered that VOCs evolved convergent strategies to remodel the host by modulating viral RNA and protein levels, altering viral and host protein phosphorylation, and rewiring virus-host protein-protein interactions. Integrative computational analyses revealed that although Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta ultimately converged to suppress interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), Omicron BA.1 did not. ISG suppression correlated with the expression of viral innate immune antagonist proteins, including Orf6, N, and Orf9b, which we mapped to specific mutations. Later Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 more potently suppressed innate immunity than early subvariant BA.1, which correlated with Orf6 levels, although muted in BA.4 by a mutation that disrupts the Orf6-nuclear pore interaction. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 convergent evolution overcame human adaptive and innate immune barriers, laying the groundwork to tackle future pandemics."
